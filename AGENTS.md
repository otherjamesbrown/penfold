# Agent Instructions

This project uses **bd** (beads) for issue tracking. Run `bd onboard` to get started.

## Quick Reference

```bash
bd ready              # Find available work
bd show <id>          # View issue details
bd update <id> --status in_progress  # Claim work
bd close <id>         # Complete work
bd sync               # Sync with git
```

## Landing the Plane (Session Completion)

**When ending a work session**, you MUST complete ALL steps below. Work is NOT complete until `git push` succeeds.

**MANDATORY WORKFLOW:**

1. **File issues for remaining work** - Create issues for anything that needs follow-up
2. **Run quality gates** (if code changed) - Tests, linters, builds
3. **Update issue status** - Close finished work, update in-progress items
4. **PUSH TO REMOTE** - This is MANDATORY:
   ```bash
   git pull --rebase
   bd sync
   git push
   git status  # MUST show "up to date with origin"
   ```
5. **Clean up** - Clear stashes, prune remote branches
6. **Verify** - All changes committed AND pushed
7. **Hand off** - Provide context for next session

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- Work is NOT complete until `git push` succeeds
- NEVER stop before pushing - that leaves work stranded locally
- NEVER say "ready to push when you are" - YOU must push
- If push fails, resolve and retry until it succeeds

# CoBuild Pipeline Instructions

This project uses CoBuild for pipeline automation. If you are an agent working on a task dispatched by CoBuild, follow these instructions.

## Project

- **Name:** penfold
- **Prefix:** pf-
- **Workflows:**
  - design: design → decompose → implement → review → done
  - bug: investigate → implement → review → done
  - bug-complex: investigate → implement → review → done
  - task: implement → review → done

## Commands

| `cobuild wi create --type <type> --title "..."` | Create work item |

## How to Run Pipelines

There are two ways to advance each phase:

### Option A: You already did the work (interactive session)

If you've already reviewed the design, decomposed into tasks, or done investigation
in the current session with the developer, just record the gate verdict:

```bash
cobuild review <id> --verdict pass --readiness 5 --body "<findings>"   # record design review
cobuild decompose <id> --verdict pass --body "<task summary>"          # record decomposition
cobuild investigate <id> --verdict pass --body "<root cause>"           # record investigation
```

The gate command records the verdict and advances the phase. No dispatch needed.

### Option B: Delegate to a separate agent (dispatch)

If you want a fresh agent to handle a phase in its own context:

```bash
cobuild dispatch <id>   # spawns agent in tmux for the current phase
cobuild wait <id>       # blocks until the agent completes
```

`cobuild dispatch` is phase-aware — it generates the right prompt automatically.
Use this for implementation (agents write code) and when you want a clean context.

### Which to use?

| Situation | Use |
|-----------|-----|
| You just reviewed the design with the developer | Option A — record the gate |
| You need an agent to write code | Option B — dispatch |
| You decomposed tasks in conversation | Option A — record the gate |
| You want investigation in a clean context | Option B — dispatch |
| Phase needs multiple file reads/edits | Option B — saves your context |

### Design Workflow

```bash
cobuild init <design-id>                     # enters design phase
cobuild dispatch <design-id>                 # spawns readiness review agent
cobuild wait <design-id>                     # wait for review to complete
# Agent records gate → advances to decompose
cobuild dispatch <design-id>                 # spawns decomposition agent
cobuild wait <design-id>                     # wait for decomposition
# Agent creates tasks, records gate → advances to implement
cobuild dispatch-wave <design-id>            # dispatch ready tasks
cobuild wait <task-1> <task-2> ...           # wait for implementation
# Repeat dispatch-wave/wait for each wave
cobuild merge-design <design-id> --dry-run   # preview merge plan
cobuild merge-design <design-id>             # merge all PRs
cobuild deploy <design-id>                   # deploy affected services
cobuild retro <design-id>                    # run retrospective
```

### Bug Workflow

**Default (most bugs):** single `fix` session — agent investigates and fixes together.

**Escalation path:** if the bug is complex, label it `needs-investigation` first — it routes to a read-only investigation phase that produces a fix spec before any code is changed.

#### When to add `needs-investigation`

Apply the label if **any** of these are true:

1. Root cause unknown (symptom visible, mechanism unclear)
2. Bug spans multiple services, modules, or repos
3. Data or security implications — need blast radius assessment before fixing
4. This area has broken before, or the fix might have unintended side effects
5. Reproduces inconsistently — needs investigation to find the trigger
6. Fix shape is non-obvious (can't describe it in 1-2 sentences)
7. Investigation produces options that require a stakeholder decision

If none apply → omit the label. The fix agent will investigate as it fixes.

#### Default bug flow

```bash
cobuild init <bug-id>                        # enters fix phase
cobuild dispatch <bug-id>                    # spawns fix agent (investigate + implement)
cobuild wait <bug-id>                        # wait for fix
cobuild merge <bug-id>                       # merge the fix PR
cobuild deploy <bug-id>                      # deploy if needed
```

#### Complex bug flow (needs-investigation label)

```bash
cobuild wi label add <bug-id> needs-investigation
cobuild init <bug-id>                        # enters investigate phase
cobuild dispatch <bug-id>                    # spawns investigation agent (READ-ONLY)
cobuild wait <bug-id>                        # wait for investigation
# Agent records investigation report + gate → creates fix task → advances to implement
cobuild dispatch <fix-task-id>               # spawns implementing agent
cobuild wait <fix-task-id>                   # wait for fix
cobuild merge <fix-task-id>                  # merge the fix PR
cobuild deploy <bug-id>                      # deploy if needed
```

### Task Workflow

```bash
cobuild init <task-id>                       # enters implement phase
cobuild dispatch <task-id>                   # spawns implementing agent
cobuild wait <task-id>                       # wait for completion
cobuild merge <task-id>                      # merge PR
```

**Key:** `cobuild dispatch` is phase-aware. It reads the current pipeline phase and generates the right prompt automatically — investigation prompt for bugs, readiness review for designs, implementation for tasks. You don't need different commands for different phases.

## Task Completion Protocol

When you have completed your implementation:

1. Run tests: `make test && make vet`
2. Build: `make build`
3. **Run `cobuild complete <task-id>`**

The Stop hook will run `cobuild complete` automatically when you finish.
If it fails, run it manually as your last action.

## Orchestrator Protocol

If you are the orchestrating agent (dispatching tasks, not implementing them),
**follow through the full lifecycle. Do not stop after dispatch.**

After dispatching tasks:

1. **Monitor** — use `cobuild audit <id>` or `cobuild status` for instant checks (do NOT use `cobuild wait` as a background task — it's a 2-hour blocking command)
2. **Review** — when tasks reach `review` phase (PRs created), check Gemini review findings via `gh api repos/<owner>/<repo>/pulls/<pr>/comments`
3. **Address blockers** — send HIGH findings back to the agent (via tmux send-keys) or fix directly
4. **Merge** — `cobuild merge <task-id>` (or `gh pr merge <pr> --admin --squash` if cobuild merge fails)
5. **Close** — update work item status to closed
6. **Report** — tell the user what shipped, not "want me to review?"

Only pause for user input if there is an actual blocker: merge conflict, critical Gemini finding you can't resolve, or a design decision needed.

## What CoBuild manages vs what you do directly

Be explicit when reporting status. State clearly whether an action is:
- **A CoBuild pipeline action** — "CoBuild will handle this: `cobuild merge-design <id>`"
- **A direct action you'll take** — "I'll run the deploy command now"
- **A human action needed** — "You need to approve this PR"
