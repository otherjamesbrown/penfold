description: Review a design for pipeline readiness. Pre-flight check before submitting to CoBuild. Trigger on "review design", "design review", "is this ready".
summary: >-
  Pre-flight check before submitting a design to the pipeline. Evaluates the design against readiness criteria, checks project-specific constraints, and reports findings by severity. Offers to submit to CoBuild when everything passes.

# Skill: Design Review

Review a design work item to determine if it's ready to submit to the CoBuild pipeline. This is an interactive pre-flight check — it evaluates the design, reports findings, and offers to submit when everything passes.

**This skill does NOT decompose into tasks.** Decomposition happens automatically after the design enters the pipeline and passes the formal readiness gate.

## Input

A design work item ID: `$ARGUMENTS`

If no ID is provided, ask the developer which design to review.

## Step 1: Read the design

```bash
cobuild wi show <design-id>
```

Read the full content. Understand what it's proposing.

## Step 2: Check readiness criteria

Evaluate each criterion. Be specific about what's present and what's missing.

| # | Criterion | What to look for |
|---|-----------|-----------------|
| 1 | **Problem stated** | Concrete description of what's broken, missing, or painful. Specific file paths, behaviors, error messages — not vague complaints. |
| 2 | **User identified** | Who benefits from this change? Could be a person, another system, or an agent. |
| 3 | **Success criteria** | Measurable acceptance criteria that an agent could verify. "Works correctly" is not testable. "Returns 200 with valid JSON matching schema X" is. |
| 4 | **Scope boundaries** | What's explicitly out of scope or deferred. Without this, implementing agents gold-plate. |
| 5 | **Test strategy** | How will this be tested? Unit tests (what's mocked), integration tests (what hits real deps), e2e tests (full flow). If the project needs test infrastructure (fixtures, test DB setup), is that mentioned? |
| 5 | **Links to parent** | Design should be linked to a parent outcome or initiative. Check edges. |

## Step 3: Check implementability

Could an implementing agent write code from this design without asking any questions?

| Area | Pass if |
|------|---------|
| Technical approach | Specified — not "TBD" or "to be decided" |
| Code locations | File paths or modules identified |
| Data model | Schema changes described with field names and types |
| API surface | Endpoints, commands, or interfaces defined |
| Migration / rollout | Strategy stated, even if "single PR, no migration needed" |
| Error handling | What happens on failure is defined |

## Step 4: Check project-specific constraints

If the project has architectural principles or conventions (e.g., "all config in database", "no hardcoded values"), check the design against them. Look for:

- Violations of documented principles
- Hardcoded values that should be configurable
- New systems that duplicate existing ones
- Missing references to existing infrastructure

## Step 5: Report findings

Present findings as a table grouped by severity:

| Severity | Meaning |
|----------|---------|
| CRITICAL | Blocks pipeline submission — must fix |
| HIGH | Should fix before submission — will likely fail the formal gate |
| MEDIUM | Worth addressing but won't block |
| LOW | Suggestions for improvement |

For each finding, state:
- What's wrong
- Why it matters (which criterion or principle it violates)
- What a fix looks like

## Step 6: Determine verdict

### If there are CRITICAL or HIGH findings:

> **Verdict: NOT READY**
>
> The following must be addressed before submitting to the pipeline:
> 1. [list of CRITICAL/HIGH findings with suggested fixes]
>
> Fix these and run `/design-review <id>` again.

### If all criteria pass (no CRITICAL or HIGH):

> **Verdict: READY FOR PIPELINE**
>
> This design passes all readiness criteria and implementability checks.
>
> **Next step:** Submit to the CoBuild pipeline? This will:
> 1. Initialize the pipeline on this design (`cobuild init <design-id>`)
> 2. Run the formal readiness gate (recorded in the audit trail)
> 3. If it passes, automatically advance to decomposition
> 4. Decompose into tasks with dependency ordering
> 5. Dispatch agents to implement each task
>
> Submit now? (yes/no)

If the developer confirms, run:

```bash
cobuild init <design-id>
```

This starts the pipeline. The formal readiness gate will run automatically.

## What this skill does NOT do

- **Does not decompose into tasks** — that's the decompose phase, after the design enters the pipeline
- **Does not create child work items** — decomposition creates tasks
- **Does not record a formal gate verdict** — `cobuild init` triggers the formal gate
- **Does not modify the design** — it reports findings for the developer to fix

## Gotchas

- Do not flag "no child tasks" — tasks don't exist yet, that's the point of the pipeline
- Do not flag "no PR" or "no branch" — implementation hasn't started
- This is a pre-flight check, not a gate. The formal gate runs after `cobuild init`
